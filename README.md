# PIZZA SALES DASHBOARD
# 1) PIZZA SALES PROJECT
* The Pizza Sales Analysis Project aims to analyze and visualize the sales performance of a pizza restaurant using real transactional data. The dataset contains detailed information such as
  order date,time, pizza category, size, price, and quantity sold. By transforming this raw data into meaningful insights, the project helps identify key trends, customer preferences, and business
  growth opportunities.
* The main objective of this project is to understand the factors that drive revenue and customer demand. Through data cleaning, modeling, and visualization, the analysis uncovers which pizzas are
  most popular, which sizes generate higher profits, and how sales fluctuate over time. This allows business owners to make data-driven decisions such as adjusting menu prices, promoting
  best-selling items, and optimizing operational efficiency.
# 2) 🧠 Technologies & Tools Used
1. Data Storage & Source
Microsoft Excel – Used as the primary data source containing pizza sales transactions, order details, and
pricing information.
CSV/XLSX File Format – Structured format for importing data into analytical tools.
2. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Power Query (in Power BI / Excel) – Used to clean, transform, and format the raw data (handling missing values, changing data types, and creating calculated columns).
Python (optional) – For advanced preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and automation using libraries like:
pandas – for data manipulation
numpy – for numerical operations
matplotlib / seaborn – for initial visual analysis
