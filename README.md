# PIZZA SALES DASHBOARD
# 1) PIZZA SALES PROJECT
* The Pizza Sales Analysis Project aims to analyze and visualize the sales performance of a pizza restaurant using real transactional data. The dataset contains detailed information such as
  order date,time, pizza category, size, price, and quantity sold. By transforming this raw data into meaningful insights, the project helps identify key trends, customer preferences, and business
  growth opportunities.
* The main objective of this project is to understand the factors that drive revenue and customer demand. Through data cleaning, modeling, and visualization, the analysis uncovers which pizzas are
  most popular, which sizes generate higher profits, and how sales fluctuate over time. This allows business owners to make data-driven decisions such as adjusting menu prices, promoting
  best-selling items, and optimizing operational efficiency.
